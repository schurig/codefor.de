München Transparent ("Munich Transparent") is a plattform allowing the inhabitants of Munich fast and simple insight to municipal politics. This is achieved by presenting the normally difficult to access data from the Munich municipal information system ("Ratsinformationssystem") in a clean and pleasent interface. The data contains over 180,000 documents, ranging from city council proposals over resolution drafts to the daily newspaper of the city council, call "Rathausumschau". That's how you can get to know what the city council is doing at the moment and which are the hot topics in the city council and in the city district councils.

München Transparent does not only want to deliver data, but also explain the procedures in municipal politics. Therefore, there's a coprehensive glossary besides video explaining the way an initative takes bevor it becomes actual policy.

Besides an RSS-feed and a calendar export there's the possibility to be notified via e-mail when there are new documents concerning a certain topic. In extend to that, there is information about city concellors, the members of the city district councils, fixed dates, agendas and protocolls as well as list of statutes and regulations. For automated access an OParl-API is provisioned.

The software behind München Transparent ist Open Source (The Source Code is available on GitHub) and was developed by Tobias Hößl, Bernd Oswald and Konstantin Schütze.
